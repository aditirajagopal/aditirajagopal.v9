The longer spiel: Iâ€™m currently an associate at Invest Detroit Ventures, where I cultivate relationships with entrepreneurs and ecosystem partners. I also design and implement data systems to better manage our pipeline, KPIs and over 100 portfolio companies. I recently graduated from University of Virginia, where I learned from the best at Transform Capital, Fin VC, AmplifyHer and CoderPad. I started my career as a software engineer at IBM where I built open source cloud infrastructure products including IBM Cloud, Kubernetes, OpenStack and Docker. 


#### ðŸŒ± Things I am currently working on: 
- Making my personal site the best it can be (check out the v7 repo)
- Internet audit - what do I have out there, what can be cleaned up, and what can be revamped
- Putting together learning goals and a personal learning plan for Q1  

#### :muscle: Things I am challenging myself to do:
- Lifestyle audit and improvements 
- Doing a little more coding and learning on a weekly if not daily basis (more data science! gotta make use of coursera and udemy!)
- Put myself out there a bit more

### ðŸ’¡ Goals for 2022:
- T
- B
- D
